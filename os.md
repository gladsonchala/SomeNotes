- **Operating System (OS) Overview:**
  - Acts as a mediator between users and computer hardware.
  - Aims to execute user programs, enhance user problem-solving, ensure convenience, and optimize hardware usage.

- **Four Components of a Computer System:**
  - Hardware: Includes CPU, memory, and I/O devices.
  - Operating System: Controls and coordinates hardware usage.
  - Application Programs: Utilize system resources to solve user problems.
  - Users: Includes people, machines, and other computers.

- **Functions of Operating Systems:**
  - Resource allocation: Manages and allocates system resources efficiently.
  - Control: Regulates program execution to prevent errors and misuse.

- **Computer Startup:**
  - Bootstrap program initializes system and loads OS kernel.

- **Computer System Operation:**
  - Involves CPUs and device controllers connected via a common bus.
  - Concurrent execution of CPUs and devices, with shared memory access.

- **Interrupt Handling:**
  - Interrupts transfer control to service routines, saving the interrupted instruction's address.
  - Interrupt-driven architecture, with separate code segments for different interrupt types.

- **I/O Structure:**
  - User programs can idle CPU until I/O completion or continue execution.
  - System call requests OS to allow user to wait for I/O completion.
  - Device-status table tracks I/O device status and handles interrupts.

- **Storage Structure and Hierarchy:**
  - Main memory: Directly accessible, volatile storage.
  - Secondary storage: Larger, nonvolatile storage extension.
  - Storage hierarchy based on speed, cost, and volatility, with caching improving access speed.

- **Caching:**
  - Copies frequently used information from slower to faster storage.
  - Faster storage (cache) checked first for data access, improving performance.

- **Direct Memory Access (DMA) Structure:**
  - Utilized by high-speed I/O devices to transfer data directly from buffer storage to main memory without CPU intervention.
  - Generates only one interrupt per block instead of per byte.

- **Computer-System Architecture:**
  - Most systems employ a single general-purpose processor.
  - Special-purpose processors are also common.
  - Multiprocessor systems, including symmetric and asymmetric multiprocessing, are increasingly prevalent.

- **Process Management:**
  - Processes are units of work within the system, actively executing programs.
  - Single-threaded and multi-threaded processes exist, with multiple processes concurrently running on one or more CPUs.
  - OS handles process creation, deletion, suspension, resumption, synchronization, communication, and deadlock handling.

- **Memory Management:**
  - Ensures necessary program instructions and data are in memory for execution.
  - Activities include tracking memory usage, deciding process/data placement, and allocating/deallocating memory space.

- **Storage Management:**
  - OS provides a logical view of information storage, abstracting physical properties to files and directories.
  - Manages file-system, mass-storage, and tertiary storage, including free-space management, storage allocation, and disk scheduling.

- **I/O Subsystem:**
  - OS abstracts hardware device peculiarities from users.
  - I/O subsystem handles memory management, buffering, caching, spooling, and provides a device-driver interface.

- **Protection and Security:**
  - Protection involves mechanisms controlling access to OS-defined resources by processes or users.
  - Security encompasses defense against internal and external threats, ranging from denial-of-service attacks to identity theft.
  - Systems differentiate users via user IDs and group IDs, managing access control accordingly.
  - Privilege escalation allows users to switch to IDs with greater rights.

- **Kernel Data Structures:**
  - Various data structures, including singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, circular linked lists, binary search trees, hash maps, and bitmaps, are used in kernel development.

- **Computing Environments:**
  - Traditional environments include standalone machines and interconnected systems, with network security becoming crucial.
  - Mobile environments feature handheld devices with additional features like GPS and support for new app types.
  - Distributed computing involves networked systems, with client-server and peer-to-peer models prevalent.
  - Virtualization enables running applications within other OSes, useful for development, testing, and managing compute environments.
  - Cloud computing delivers computing resources as a service over networks, with various types such as public, private, and hybrid clouds.
  - Real-time embedded systems are widespread, requiring real-time operating systems to meet fixed time constraints.
  - Open-source operating systems provide source code access, promoting transparency and collaboration.

# Scheduling
- **Basic Concepts:**
  - Maximum CPU utilization is achieved through multiprogramming.
  - The CPU-I/O Burst Cycle involves alternating CPU execution and I/O wait periods.
  - CPU burst distribution is a primary concern.

- **CPU Scheduler:**
  - The short-term scheduler selects processes from the ready queue and allocates the CPU to one of them.
  - Scheduling decisions occur during state transitions like running to waiting, running to ready, or waiting to ready.
  - Scheduling can be preemptive or nonpreemptive, depending on the context.

- **Dispatcher:**
  - The dispatcher module switches CPU control to the selected process, involving context switching and mode transitions.

- **Scheduling Criteria:**
  - CPU utilization, throughput, turnaround time, waiting time, and response time are key metrics for evaluating scheduling algorithms.

- **Scheduling Algorithm Optimization Criteria:**
  - The goal is to maximize CPU utilization, throughput, and minimize turnaround time, waiting time, and response time.

- **Scheduling Algorithms:**
  - **First-Come, First-Served (FCFS):** Processes are executed in the order they arrive, leading to the convoy effect.
  - **Shortest-Job-First (SJF):** Processes with the shortest CPU burst are prioritized, minimizing average waiting time.
  - **Priority Scheduling:** Processes are assigned priorities, with the CPU allocated to the highest priority process.
  - **Round Robin (RR):** Each process gets a small time quantum, preventing starvation and ensuring fairness.
  - **Multilevel Queue:** Ready queue is partitioned into separate queues, each with its own scheduling algorithm.
  - **Multilevel Feedback Queue:** Processes move between queues based on feedback, allowing for dynamic prioritization.

- **Examples and Optimization:**
  - Estimating the length of the next CPU burst is crucial for optimizing algorithms like SJF.
  - Various parameters, such as time quantum in RR or priority assignment, impact scheduling performance.

These scheduling techniques aim to balance CPU utilization, response time, and fairness among processes, contributing to efficient system operation.

# Thread scheduling 

Thread scheduling in operating systems involves managing the execution of threads, distinguishing between user-level and kernel-level threads. Here are some key points:

- **User-level vs. Kernel-level Threads:**
  - Threads can be managed either at the user level or the kernel level.
  - In user-level threading, thread scheduling is handled by a thread library, and the kernel is unaware of threads.
  - In kernel-level threading, threads are managed by the operating system kernel, providing better support for multithreading.

- **Pthread Scheduling:**
  - The pthread API allows specifying scheduling scope during thread creation, choosing between process-contention scope (PCS) and system-contention scope (SCS).
  - PCS schedules threads within the process, typically based on priorities set by the programmer.
  - SCS schedules threads across the entire system, with competition among all threads.

- **Multiple-Processor Scheduling:**
  - With multiple CPUs, scheduling becomes more complex.
  - Symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) allows each processor to schedule its own processes.
  - Load balancing ensures that all CPUs are efficiently utilized.

- **Multicore Processors:**
  - Multicore processors place multiple CPU cores on the same chip, improving performance and power efficiency.
  - Multiple threads per core are supported, taking advantage of memory stall to make progress on other threads.

- **Real-Time CPU Scheduling:**
  - Real-time systems have strict timing requirements.
  - Soft real-time systems have no guarantee of meeting deadlines, while hard real-time systems must meet deadlines.
  - Interrupt latency and dispatch latency affect real-time performance.

- **Scheduling Algorithms:**
  - Rate Monotonic Scheduling assigns priorities based on the inverse of task periods.
  - Earliest Deadline First Scheduling assigns priorities based on deadlines.
  - POSIX Real-Time Scheduling API provides functions for managing real-time threads and setting scheduling policies.

In summary, thread scheduling involves managing the execution of threads efficiently, considering factors like scheduling scope, processor affinity, and real-time requirements.

## cheduling in Linux, Windows, and Solaris:

**Linux Scheduling:**
- Before kernel version 2.5, Linux used a variation of the standard UNIX scheduling algorithm.
- Version 2.5 introduced the Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS), which is priority-based and preemptive.
- CFS assigns priorities based on a proportion of CPU time rather than fixed time allotments.
- It maintains per-task virtual run time and selects the next task to run based on the lowest virtual run time.
- Real-time scheduling in Linux follows the POSIX.1b standard, where real-time tasks have static priorities mapped into the global priority scheme.

**Windows Scheduling:**
- Windows uses priority-based preemptive scheduling.
- The highest-priority thread runs next, and the dispatcher serves as the scheduler.
- Real-time threads can preempt non-real-time threads.
- Windows implements a 32-level priority scheme with variable and real-time classes.
- Threads are organized into queues based on priority, and an idle thread runs if no other threads are runnable.
- Windows 7 introduced user-mode scheduling (UMS), allowing applications to create and manage threads independently of the kernel.

**Solaris Scheduling:**
- Solaris uses priority-based scheduling with six available classes, including time sharing, interactive, real-time, system, fair share, and fixed priority.
- Each class has its own scheduling algorithm, with time sharing using a multi-level feedback queue.
- The scheduler converts class-specific priorities into per-thread global priorities, and threads with the highest priority run next.
- Multiple threads at the same priority are selected using round-robin scheduling.

These operating systems employ different scheduling algorithms and mechanisms to manage the execution of threads and processes efficiently. Each system has its own approach to prioritizing tasks and managing CPU resources based on the specific requirements and design principles of the operating system.

# File system interface:

**File Concept:**
- Files are represented as contiguous logical address spaces.
- Types of files include data files (numeric, character, binary) and program files (contents defined by the file's creator, such as text files, source files, and executable files).

**File Attributes:**
- Attributes include the name, identifier, type, location, size, protection, time, date, and user identification.
- Information about files is stored in the directory structure, which is maintained on the disk.

**File Operations:**
- File operations include creating, writing, reading, repositioning within the file (seek), deleting, and truncating files.
- Files are treated as abstract data types, and operations like opening and closing involve searching the directory structure on disk and managing file pointers.

**Open Files:**
- Managing open files involves several pieces of data, including an open-file table, file pointer, file-open count, disk location of the file, and access rights per process.
- Open file locking can be provided by some operating systems and file systems, mediating access to a file either mandatorily or advisably.

**File Locking Example - Java API:**
- Java provides APIs for file locking, allowing processes to acquire shared or exclusive locks on specific regions of a file to control access.
- Locks can be released after operations are completed to allow other processes to access the file.

**File Structure:**
- Files can have simple record structures like lines or fixed-length records, or more complex structures like formatted documents or relocatable load files.
- Sequential-access and direct-access methods are used for reading and writing data, and other access methods can be built on top of these base methods.

**Directory Structure:**
- The directory structure is a collection of nodes containing information about all files.
- Directories and files reside on disk, with each volume containing a file system tracking its information in the device directory or volume table of contents.

**Disk Structure:**
- Disks can be subdivided into partitions, which can be RAID protected against failure.
- Partitions can be formatted with a file system, and each volume containing a file system tracks its information.
- There are general-purpose file systems and special-purpose file systems within the same operating system or computer.

## Types of file systems and operations performed on directories:

**Types of File Systems:**
- General-purpose file systems are common, but systems often have both general-purpose and special-purpose file systems.
- Examples include tmpfs for fast temporary I/O, objfs for kernel symbol access, ctfs for managing daemons, lofs for loopback access, procfs for kernel process structures, and general-purpose file systems like ufs and zfs.

**Operations Performed on Directories:**
- Operations on directories include searching for a file, creating, deleting, listing, renaming files, and traversing the file system.

**Directory Organization:**
- Directories are organized logically for efficiency in locating files quickly and for convenient naming.
- Grouping allows logical grouping of files by properties, such as all Java programs or all games.

**Directory Structure:**
- Different directory structures include single-level directory, two-level directory, tree-structured directories, and acyclic-graph directories.
- Tree-structured directories offer efficient searching and grouping capabilities, with a current directory for navigation.

**File System Mounting:**
- Before accessing a file system, it must be mounted at a mount point.
- Mounting involves attaching the file system to the directory tree of the file system's host operating system.

**File Sharing:**
- File sharing is desirable in multi-user systems and can be achieved through protection schemes.
- Remote file systems enable file sharing across networks, with protocols like NFS (Unix) and CIFS (Windows).
- Failure modes and consistency semantics dictate how multiple users access shared files simultaneously.
- Access control lists and groups are used to manage file access permissions, allowing the file owner to control what can be done by whom.
